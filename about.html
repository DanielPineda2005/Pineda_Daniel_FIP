            <p>Ontario's Couples Resort is on the shores of Algonquin Park's <a href="#">Galeairy Lake</a>, which mostly is in Algonquin Park, and the Madawaska River. The village of Whitney, Ontario is a short 15-minute walk away. Algonquin Park being our back yard we are surrounded with breathtaking wilderness, pure fresh air, secluded forests, pristine waters, an abundance of sunny days and a blanket of stars at night.</p>
            <p>A 5-STAR Luxury Resort for 46 couples. Endless Nature and Sports Activities, together with Pampering Spa Treatments and followed by Decadent Gourmet dining by our International Chefs.
                Those of you who need to escape from the bustle will find us <a href="#">calming and rejuvenating.</a> There are many ways to do nothing if that is your wish. On the other hand, unlimited activities will keep the adventurer active all year round. Ontario's Natural Algonquin Park is ideal for the sport enthusiast or avid adventurer who will be delighted with the extraordinary activities available.
                "Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort.  Here you will find the time to spend quality time together, and this is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend lots of time together.  We, the Sorensen Family, started in 1967 to take care of guests, in 1989 we moved to couples only (no kids and no meetings/conferences) as we knew that many couples needed special time together.  In 2006, Canada Select which was rating 4000 accommodation properties in Canada, decided we should join them because we were easily in the top 1%, a 5 Star, and we are glad we made it for you to enjoy as you deserve it.  Now, many times of the year, we offer rates super discounted as we wish to be accessible to as many couples as possible, as all couples should benefit from quiet time together.  We have learned over the decades from our guests that those guests that have a love for gratitude for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, daily I ask how grateful am I, and I hope you are filled with many things that you are grateful for.  If you know other couples who need time away please pass on the word."
                2018, IceHiking invented by John Sorensen, 50 years after Father, Fritz Sorensen opened up Cross Country Skiing in Algonquin Park, now get out and go and enjoy Nature!</p>
                <p>Your Hosts, The Sorensen Family & Team The Couples Resort, Ontario - Canada
                    FYI * #1 Romantic Resort in Ontario.  Defined by when we were paying TripAdvisor over $10,000 a year to belong to them they rated us #1 in Ontario. The moment we stopped paying them the annual fee we were completely dropped from their list. We refuse to have TripAdvisor use Extortion on us to belong to their listings.  Yet TripAdvisor continues to still publish the reviews, and this is ethically just wrong as they are using their Power to Punish us and this is Blackmail.  Hope you agree with us.</p>
